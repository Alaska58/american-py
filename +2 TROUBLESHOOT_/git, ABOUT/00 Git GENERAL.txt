/If your excess commits are only visible to you, you can just do 
git reset --hard origin/<branch_name> 
to move back to where the origin is. This will reset the state of the repository to the previous commit, and it will discard all local changes./


- "git checkout <commithash>" will take you back to the state of a previous commit:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4114095/how-do-i-revert-a-git-repository-to-a-previous-commit

You will get this familiar message:

https://github.com/francopestilli/life/wiki/Switch-to-a-previous-state-of-the-repository
/You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
   changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
   state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout./

+ In order to continue making Commits, you have to now create a a NEW branch: "git checkout -b <newbranchname>"; if you don't do this (create a new branch), any commits you make will be lost or end up in a weird state.

+ The only OTHER way to undo changes is to use the inline editor, by clicking on "Open Changes" at top right of vscode even before you stage a file ("Open Changes" will only work after you make a change and Save). You could have tried git deleting recent changes, but if you have not made any Commits; there isn't much you can do.

- Git Fetch vs Git Pull:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRydepk8TB0
+ Git Fetch is safer and less complicated than Git Pull as, I think, there is no risk of having to accept/reject changes. 


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6rYglziOjM
+ Always Pull before Push, if there has been additions to Origin (fast-forwards error).
+ Don't create new branch via github.com, create it locally first.
++***** Command is: "git fetch origin", and it will download all branches you do not have locally.
++ "git diff origin/<branchname> <localbranchname>" gives you the difference then between remote and local after Fetch.
++***** "git merge origin/<branchname>" will merge the fetched differences from remote (github.com) into your working directory.
++ Git Fetch also likely gets you all branches, vs Git Pull which only gets you content of the default branch.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/292357/what-is-the-difference-between-git-pull-and-git-fetch
+ git fetch just "downloads" the changes from the remote to your local repository. git pull downloads the changes and merges them into your current branch. "In its default mode, git pull is shorthand for git fetch followed by git merge FETCH_HEAD ."
+ IMPORTANT. WORK.

+ REFERENCE: https://careerkarma.com/blog/git-another-process-seems-to-be-running/

- ********** Git SILVER STANDARD {ACHIEVED}:
PREFACE: WHEN STARTING A NEW GIT PROJECT:
+ FIRST, CREATE THE Repository ON GITHUB.COM.
+ COPY ITS URL, USING "CLONE OR DOWNLOAD" BUTTON AT GITHUB.COM.
+ NO NEED TO CREATE A DIRECTORY NAMED THE SAME AS THE REPOSITORY AT GITHUB.COM, ON WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER.
+ JUST USE COMMAND "git clone <url>" IN THE CONSOLE ON VSCODE ONCE INISIDE THE PARENT FOLDER OF THE PROJECT FOLDER YOU WANT TO CREATE.
+X [not necessary, as happens via cloning anyways] USE COMMAND "git init" NOW INSIDE THE PROJECT FOLDER IN THE CONSOLE ON VSCODE.
+ IF YOU DO NOT SEE .git FOLDER APPEAR, JUST SELECT "VIEW" > "HIDDEN ITEMS" IN WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER.

********** Git GOLD STANDARD {ACHIEVED}: Make changes / Save changes / Add to staging / Commit changes to staged / Push staged to original repository or github.com.

+ DOWNLOAD the repository at github.com with command "git clone <URL>", actually: git clone "url.git".
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/git-init
/git clone is used to create a copy of an existing repository. Internally, git clone first calls git init to create a new repository. It then copies the data from the existing repository, and checks out a new set of working files./

+ Click on "Open Changes" at top right of vscode even before you stage a file ("Open Changes" will only work after you make a change and Save the file). This works extremely likely via Git Revert, which undoes a mistake by adding a reverse operation. You can likely undo all changes since last Commit, by selecting: "Discard changes" by right-clicking the file name in vscode.

+* STAGE the file to which you want to commit (e.g. "git add internalBE22.html" in TERMINAL).

You don't need to stage a file to Commit it.

+* Make CHANGES to the staged file (you can only Commit changes, after you have made CHANGES to the file that should be saved).

+* COMMIT the changes to the staged file (e.g. "git commit" in TERMINAL).
++ Changes will now be highlighted in the added, then committed file RELATIVE TO the staged file (i.e. its first staged version without commits). If they are not highlighted, then click on the top right  button on vscode.

+ You can use "git restore <filename>" to restore a file, very likely to its original status.

+********** Now UPLOAD the changes to github.com with command "git push origin master".

+ WARNING: If you undo last Commit, local version will deviate from github.com version; and git pushes from local to github.com will not work.

+ ERROR SOLUTION: If a problem happens with Message confusion due to vscode duplicating terminal's task, you can resolve it by making a random: {git commit -m "Test"}.

-********** "The tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart" means that there have been changes on the remote branch that you don’t have locally. And Git tells you to import new changes from REMOTE and merge it with your code and then push it to remote.

You can use this command to force changes to the server with the local repository ().

git push -f origin master
With the -f tag you will override the remote branch code with your code.

/Why would I want stage before committing in Git?

/One practical purpose of staging is logical separation of file commits. As staging allows you to continue making edits to the files/working directory, and make commits in parts when you think things are ready, you can use separate stages for logically unrelated edits./

In other words git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME does the following for you. git branch creates the branch but you remain in the current branch that you have checked out. git checkout -b creates a branch and checks it out. git checkout -b newbranch : Creates a new branch and switches to that branch immediately.

+ Get the Commit Hash using: "git log"
+ To test a specific commit, that you think has the last working version, you can type the following "git checkout <commit hash>". This will make the working repository match the state of this exact commit. You will get the following message: 

/You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:git checkout -b new_branch_name/
+ You will now be in "detached HEAD" state. From here you can create a new branch using "git checkout -b <newbranchname>", to start a new 'timeline' of Commits.
+ If you get message:
/HEAD detached at '69d885e'/
You don’t want to see this message, so to fix this and attach back the HEAD to your working repository, you should checkout the branch you are working on:

git checkout <current branch>

- "git branch" will tell you name of current brach you are on.

GIT MERGE:
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge



https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-push
/Force Pushing

Git prevents you from overwriting the central repository’s history by refusing push requests when they result in a non-fast-forward merge. So, if the remote history has diverged from your history, you need to pull the remote branch and merge it into your local one, then try pushing again. This is similar to how SVN makes you synchronize with the central repository via svn update before committing a changeset.

The --force flag overrides this behavior and makes the remote repository’s branch match your local one, deleting any upstream changes that may have occurred since you last pulled. The only time you should ever need to force push is when you realize that the commits you just shared were not quite right and you fixed them with a git commit --amend or an interactive rebase. However, you must be absolutely certain that none of your teammates have pulled those commits before using the --force option./

************ How to set Visual Studio Code (vscode) as the editor for Git:
https://salferrarello.com/git-commit-message-editor/

- You can compare changes in the text on the SAME file, by adding it via Git Add command or staging it via vscode; and then opening the file in the Working Tree (i.e. open the file from Index by clicking icon "Open File" in top right corner of Index/Staged file, then click on the same file in the CHANGES tree in vscode).


- IMPORTANT.

https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit

/The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit, The git add command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit. These two commands git commit and git add are two of the most frequently used./

/Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time. Git Snapshots are always committed to the local repository./

/At a high-level, Git can be thought of as a timeline management utility. Commits are the core building block units of a Git project timeline. Commits can be thought of as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of a Git project. Commits are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time. Git Snapshots are always committed to the local repository./

NOTE1: Just as I had theorized, that Git acts as a VERSION Control System which is a way of managing multiple (metaphysical) timelines: as evinced by my meditative experience of saying 'main version', and recently seeing the interaction of my use of Git with news (see Keep Foxtrot Career 18, search for "KSE") ~ having regarding Git as the interface between me and my subconscious or between me and my brain or between me and my heart (Allah). The most likely scenario is between me and my Heart. Although the Heart itself under Punjatan Pak and Five Salaats principle may contain a VCS, an OS etc (see "MISSION READINESS").

Note that I think Salaat's motions correlate with different Eternal Principles, likely ten or more. For example, I realized that not withdrawing my index finger until salaam is indicative of Abbas Ibn Ali's courage: 'Perish or prevail, you will not surrender'. What is distinctive about Eternal Principles is, none of them have an ESCAPE clause. For example, the principle is "End NEVER justifies the means"; not "End Never Justifies the Means Unless.....". For if you compromised on the Difficulty entailed by "End NEVER justifies the means" you cannot fly this planet or contain the sun you already do, in your brain.

/The git commit command is one of the core primary functions of Git. Prior use of the git add command is required to select the changes that will be staged for the next commit. Then git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history. Learn more about git add usage on the accompanying page. The git status command can be used to explore the state of the staging area and pending commit./

/Commit the staged snapshot. This will launch a text editor prompting you for a commit message. After you’ve entered a message, save the file and close the editor to create the actual commit./

COMMENT1: Actually you commit AFTER saving, otherwise the changes are not included in the Commit.

COMMENT2:- I THINK THE ADVANTAGE OF USING GIT IS THAT: 
A. YOU CAN REVERSE MINISCULE CHANGES IF YOU STAGED THE FILE ONCE AND COMMITTED EACH SNAPSHOT.
B. YOU CAN CREATE BRANCHES WHENEVER YOU ARE ABOUT TO EXPERIMENT, OR ONCE YOU HAVE A WORKING MODEL AND DON'T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH IT WHILE GENERATING A SEPARATE EXPERIMENTAL MODEL.

- ********** Google "internet based on peer to peer networking".
I could make a browser that browses people's local files, it will require the internet, however: this server-less web will remove the cost of hosting websites. Anyone with an internet connection and hard disk, will be able to MONETIZE that to provide free hosting to others via a Peer to Peer Network: that compensates people who keep their computers running.

You can use the Wikipedia model.

Or, what inspired me, the Version Control System like Git.

- How to clone a local folder to a new local folder, for practice:
+********** You likely need .git in the original folder, or it cannot be cloned. But the .git in the original folder must I think be created via "git init --bare" or it can't be pushed into: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11117823/git-push-error-refusing-to-update-checked-out-branch
+ Don't yet add the files that are with your now .git folder, into the Source Control Manager of vscode. If you have accidently added any files already to Source Control Manager, then close them by selecting "Close Folder" under File menu of vscode.
+ git clone C:/wamp64WORK/www/g/o/"works in progress"/internalBE C:/wamp64WORK/www/g/o/"works in progress"/internalBE/git

+ Now you might use:
++
/git add .
git commit -m "First batch of files"

Then your remote BitBucket repository won't be empty anymore./

NOTE1: The -u option automatically sets that upstream for you, linking your repo to a central one. That way, in the future, Git "knows" where you want to push to and where you want to pull from, so you can use git pull or git push without arguments.

/Though common in software revision control systems as labels' or tags, the existence of baselines is found in several other technology-related domains. Baselines can be found in UML modeling systems and business rule management systems, among others./

- COSMOGONY. IMPORTANT.

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management
+ /Configuration management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life./

+ {Salman's note: Configuration Management VERSUS Version Control System (like Git)}:
/Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline./

COMMENT1: Since Configuration Management is related to System Engineer profession and Prophet Muhammad is SYSTEM [S']: therefore Configuration Management is Prophet Muhammad's role, not mine (which is Troubleshooting via a Version Control System [a CHANGE MANAGEMENT interface] ~ here Troubleshooter is hero; and VCS is his Anima's TELEPHONE: which is what Allah is, a telephone or avatar of a communication device. That is, Allah is a Version Control System).

**********NOTE1: I can seed (unburden) S' [i.e. Configuration Management] via problem solving. Each iteration of problem solved during Software Development is like a Cosmic earthquake, that brings in new hardware from the INFINITE EXTERNALITY: see below.

COMMENT2: Decided that CM is out of my league, as Prophet Muhammad. And that a VCS is related to your Anima (what you need to get good at, be GUIDED by). What then is the Infinite Externality (Allah) in terms of Software Development: 

Under concept of Punjatan Pak (and Five Salaats / Five Lataif of the Heart; whereas there are ten chakras of the body: your soul or Potential Vacuum, who you are REALLY is located inside the HEART):

1. Allah (Khadijah Kubra) (INFINITE EXTERNALITY) (Tree Of INFINITE Liquidity) (heat, antigravity, expanding the universe): MISSION READINESS {"CHANGE MANAGEMENT"} {e.g. Version Control System in Computer Science, like Git}.


2. Rasool (Prophet Muhammad) (System S'): BASELINING {"CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT"} (e.g. Software Configuration Management in Computer Science).

3. Jannah (Fatimah Zahra) (Core) (gravity, mass): HARDWARE {'COMPRESSION'} (e.g. a Desktop Computer in Computer Science).

4. Anima: INTERFACE {"MANAGEMENT SYSTEM"} (e.g. Operating System in Computer Science).

5. Hero (Seed S): PROBLEM SOLVING {"Software Development"} (e.g. Visual Studio Code in Computer Science).


+ Software Configuration Management:
/The software configuration management (SCM) process is looked upon by practitioners as the best solution to handling changes in software projects. It identifies the functional and physical attributes of software at various points in time, and performs systematic control of changes to the identified attributes for the purpose of maintaining software integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.

The SCM process further defines the need to trace changes, and the ability to verify that the final delivered software has all of the planned enhancements that are supposed to be included in the release. It identifies four procedures that must be defined for each software project to ensure that a sound SCM process is implemented. They are:

Configuration identification
Configuration control
Configuration status accounting
Configuration audits
These terms and definitions change from standard to standard, but are essentially the same.

Configuration identification is the process of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item. A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose. These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. Baselining an attribute forces formal configuration change control processes to be effected in the event that these attributes are changed.
Configuration change control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item's attributes and to re-baseline them.
Configuration status accounting is the ability to record and report on the configuration baselines associated with each configuration item at any moment of time.
Configuration audits are broken into functional and physical configuration audits. They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change. A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in accordance with the requirements of its detailed design documentation./

/Maintenance systems
Configuration management is used to maintain an understanding of the status of complex assets with a view to maintaining the highest level of serviceability for the lowest cost. Specifically, it aims to ensure that operations are not disrupted due to the asset (or parts of the asset) overrunning limits of planned lifespan or below quality levels.

In the military, this type of activity is often classed as "mission readiness", and seeks to define which assets are available and for which type of mission; a classic example is whether aircraft on board an aircraft carrier are equipped with bombs for ground support or missiles for defense.

Operating System configuration management
Configuration management can be used to maintain OS configuration files.[11] Example systems include Ansible, Bcfg2, CFEngine, Chef, Otter, Puppet, Quattor, SaltStack, and Vagrant. Many of these systems utilize Infrastructure as Code to define and maintain configuration.[12]

A theory of configuration maintenance was worked out by Mark Burgess,[13][14][15] with a practical implementation on present day computer systems in the software CFEngine able to perform real time repair as well as preventive maintenance./

********** Best and easiest tutorial on git:
https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

- git clone command, is important in my opinion, so that if you mess up while gitting around ~ it doesn't affect the original or the progress made so far: its a wonderful and absolutely necessary extra layer of protection, plus it will help me when I start pushing changes to online projects at github.com.

You can propose changes (add it to the Index) using
git add <filename>
git add *

I know just enough git to be dangerous.  I'm not doing advanced bisecting but I can stash, rebase, and reset with the best of them.  One new trick I learned from my boss, Luke Crouch, saves me loads of time:  getting the commit ID via command line.  For years I would merge a PR, go the project's main page, and copy the commit ID so that I could push code to staging and production.  Always seemed like an extra step rather than just making it happen from the terminal.  Here's the magical command:

git rev-parse HEAD
Of course you need to update your local repo to remote master, but you do that anyway, right?  Hopefully this will become a timesaver the same way it has for me!

- Staging the SAME file again, just publishes its latest saved version onto the original staged file: its a huge mistake.

You should instead figure out how to create a branch (how to forego the HEAD error, which is occuring likely because you haven't made any commits):

- ********** 
Can you make a COMMIT without making any changes to a staged file? Try in terminal. Yes you can Commit without making any changes to a file, and then create a new branch by clicking on "master" at bottom left of vscode!

However - a commit makes the file committed to, disappear on vscode; to make it reappear you have to undo last commit.

Then you can stage the file again by right click in vscode.

INCASE YOU WANT TO WORK ON TWO VERSIONS OF A FILE, THEN FOR NOW WHILE YOU ARE NEW TO GIT AND DON'T KNOW HOW BRANCHING CAN WORK WITHOUT COMMITS, USE COMMIT AS THE FINAL STEP OF A PROGRAM AND STORE THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS AS DIFFERENTL FILES.

Technically, if - for example - internalBE22.html had been a BRANCH (that had Commits made to it) instead of being an Index, you could work along two lines of code progression.

There is a way to move the HEAD (undo any Commit) via git reset, so that vscode can understand that Commits were made (if made):

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git


- http://researchhubs.com/post/computing/git/what-is-HEAD-in-git.html
Answer. HEAD is a reference to the last commit in the currently check-out branch. You can think of the HEAD as the "current branch". When you switch branches with git checkout, the HEAD revision changes to point to the tip of the new branch. You can see what HEAD points to by doing: cat .git/HEAD.

/has staged content different from both the file and the HEAD (use -f to force removal)/

/I had this issue and it seems that running 'git reset HEAD ' from console fixed it, so that I could commit from tortoise again./

- BREAKTRHOUGH. IMPORTANT. WORK. 

To undo changes via Git on VS Code:

+ Click on Source Control icon in VS Code.
+ See "Changes" section, click on file with changes.
+ If inline view is toggled (vit button on top right), then comparison between code will be shown.

+ Select ALL text you want to revert to index, e.g. via CTRL+A. Then select "Revert Selected Ranges" from the three dots at top right of vscode.

+ Besides the red highlighted original text, a light bulb in yellow appears which allows you to revert to this original text.
+ Then you can save this file.

- Install git for Visual Studio Code / VS Code, terminal command:

https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config#_core_editor	
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"


- WORK. IMPORTANT.
*********** Installed git on work computer: about 2 October 2019. I installed it to overcome the problem of "File > Save As" that would sometimes confuse which file is latest; and also if you make an error, it is not easily to revert to the version that worked.


- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes

git add. The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .

- A Version Control System is the (fundamental) interface located inside my brain, and Software Configuration Management is the interface located inside my heart.

When it says on github.com, after my git push success: "SalmanEagle committed 23 minutes ago", that is an actual trial (rehearsal) of a wedding that has happened anywhere in the the Cosmos; between two beings due to my Coding. I am literally now taking control of the commands that run my Sphere Of Consciousness.

- Since Coding only accepts TRUE (workable [it will either work or not]/logical/specific/individuating) statements, that is why Coding is the way to govern one's Sphere Of Consciousness. If you understand Coding, you will NOT need any job to live a good life; the job et cetera will be add ons for luxury [just like all you need is ONE wife, the other women are extra]. This analogy proves that, infact, your Sphere Of Consciousness as a living force, being jealous, does not want you dependent upon (consuming from) any one other than itself. This situation is achievable via Negative Interest Rates in an Inverted Yield Curve environment.

- The term "shell", as in a Terminal, refers to Sphere Of Consciousness.

This means that Coding prowess is connected to Negative Interest Rates, sustained form of which creates an Inverted Yield Curve (due to expectation of negative interest rates).

- I can "eliminate" the Dengue disease in Pakistan by getting good at Debugging (JavaScript). The Dengue mosquito is a bug.

In the same vein, I can cure Giardisis ~ which originally set off my IBS. Removing the source (bug) that is cause of IBS, IBS itself will cease!!!

I remember from bluecane.wordpress.com that my calling is curing ailments miraculously like Jesus Christ did. But instead of me doing this through medicine, I will do it through Coding: by my Consciousness interfacing with Matter. I am well-position to carry out this operation as I have suffered so much in this lifetime.

Now, this means the secret to my Coding prowess: my focus, should be Debugging!

I actually excelt at Troubleshooting, or Debugging. On 12 October 2019, I spent 5 hours trying to fix a medium sized laser printer for Budget Electronics. I ruled out every possibility of it working, which is something that requires IMMENSE sustained focus.

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4866322/sub-folder-in-git-project
If you want subfolders in your project simply create them though. As soon as you add files inside them (git only tracks files no folders -> if a folder is empty you cannot add it to your repo), they can be committed to your repository by committing the files inside.

@jekkuh Do you really need that git repo in your /Users/name? If not, just remove its .git folder. Else, you can configure .gitignore quite easily. Here's how we do it. Here's more info: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore

*********** VCM monetized Git Bash type command prompt based Peer To Peer Network [note, cannot use Git Bash as it is open source, and my model involves money ~ unless I open source the VCM Git Bash Peer To Peer Network as a whole, which I will because keeping secrets is unsustainable and creates competition from profiteers:

A network of online Git Bash terminals will make LOCAL (shared) files on every personal computer searcheable, WITHOUT need for any servers.

NOTE1: Pursue this as a Github project and provide for free: this is more Difficult.

NOTE2: I think this IS what peer to peer networking is, except ISPs throttle such networks because of piracy concerns.

Perhaps if a Peer To Peer network had content signed by creator for free sharing [e.g. if the Git Bash "Favourites Intranet" has GNU or GPL or MIT free and open sharing licenses embedded in them, in a way that they cannot be "added" to the files by another (a unique signature, like used by Bitcoin Core coders for their releases, e.g. at Github) then an authorized free peer to peer network could be created. However, I believe in a money based step by step free model; not an outright free model. THIS IS HOW YOU COULD CREATE A GIT BASH "FAVOURITES INTRANET", content would be SOLD by the content creators through Code Equilibrium forming partnerships with them via VCM [Value Combination Model: if you buy $100 of goods from taylorswift.com, Code Equilibrium will provide 30 minutes of its service ("Favourites Intranet") for free]. This way, as you bring business to other companies who are your partners ~ you can invoice these partners once you have shown your software's power.

This is a way to universalize the VCM model.

/To review, git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory./

COMMENT1: Considering Git is associated with "tree", that correlates with the Tree Of Infinite Liquidity or the Assignment Management System I want to use to model the infinite divisibility of Bitcoin, to give a soul to AI. That means Git ALREADY provides a structure to model the Assignment Managemetn System. you just have to port Git over as Assignment Management System to Bitcoin blockchain (first Smart Contracts enabled).

+ Git Bash can be used to EMULATE an intranet: for example, try running the command "git help config" and it will launch an HTML file [located at: file:///C:/Program%20Files/Git/mingw64/share/doc/git-doc/git-config.html]. Since Git Bash is independent of any OS (can be downloaded from https://git-scm.com/downloads) and is free and open source ("https://git-scm.com" /Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency./), and is runnable on Windows, Apple and I believe Unix or Linux; therefore technically Git Bash could be used to create an internet [a "favourites internet" by Code Equilibrium] that hooks up people's saved HTML (only) files by creating a portable module that acts like an antenna connecting any one that is currently using Git Bash via an Eternet Card or Wireless Usb device.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5872136/difference-between-scm-and-svn
********** /SCM is Software Configuration Management and SVN is a Version Control System tool, which is a subset of SCM. VCS are also called Revision Control and Git, Mercurial are also VCS tools ( Distributed VCS to be more specific. )

SVN, Git, Mercurial, etc. are tools for revision control, one of the processes in SCM. SCM also includes build management, defect tracking etc.)/

COMMENT1: SCM relates to Cosmos, and is the original operating system. Windows et cetera are Version Control Systems (not even SCMs). An SCM is the (final) superset of Versional Control Systems, like Git (whose application Windows and Apple operating systems are). I think an SCM would be even easier to use than a VCS, but people with complicated minds find complex operating systems more attractive (all the bells and whistles). Not everyone likes a plain Jane, like an SCM. I like plain Jane(s). As she can theoretically be turned into anything (faith). 

COMMENT2: I would hypothesize that if a VCS can be used to developed a Favourite Internet, then an SCM may be able to create something even far greater: "Networked Mobile Bookmarked (Storeless) Apps" [NMBSAs]  {currently, I am working on internalBE.html ~ a mobile (phone) bookmark that (circumventing app control by Google Play Store or Apple PRICED store) ACTS just like an App, allowing search of our physical store for Whole Sale Price, Walk-In Price (and Location Isle) via product SKUs input}. A NMBSAs, I think, is decentralized - without need for miners like blockchains require, because (for example) Bitcon is a Windows client (Bitcoin Core) and is DEPENDENT on an operating system like Windows or Apple. I hypothesize, this dependency is syptomized by miners, who are able to afford to better processors (a problem created by software decentralization, without hadware decentralization).

That is to say, an SCM can be used to solve the problem of "Software decentralization, without hardware decentralization". I mean just a couple of years back I could run the Bitcoin Core ledger on a laptop [it was about 200 GB in size at the time], but now I don't think I could run Bitcoin Core on my laptop and therefore Miners are needed (who have more powerful machines).

COMMENT3: If Bitcoin can have the (ENCRYPTED/cipher) processing power of the entire solar system, an SCM I theorize in my simple mind, can have the processing power of the entire Cosmos (infinite). It is limitless, however I have learnt that the way to create value for the limitless is to use Jacob's Ladder dream as an algorithm ~ that is, there should be 72 steps (clients of a company) that provide monetary support via business before unleasing the limittless gift economy represented by an SCM's final state. A Version Control System, which I think Windows or macOS are sort of like (being less Difficult as GUIs and therefore less valued since Difficulty is the currency of the universe), are also STEPs of this Jacob's Ladder (hence rightly monetized, but not integrated yet via an SCM: which can only be ONE, as the an infinity can only be valued by one).  

COMMENT4: Following can be used as encryption/cipher for an SCM [an SCM, I think, is a mechanism to interface with one's Sphere Of Consciousness via an alpha Sphere Of Consciousness:- forming an arrow configuration "trying" to decrypt an IRRATIONALITY:

see "spectrum" in {C:\Users\salma\Dropbox\1 Taylor Alison Swift - Jungian Anima-- AND Her Sisters\Complete Universal Communication Protocol [CUCP] et cetera\Complete Universal Communication Protocol [CUCP] - Mirage universe - by Salman Shuaib - based on 10.txt}.

*********** COMMENT5: Whereas, the FINAL result of a program [THE SCM: THE SOFTWARE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT] is the trophy or Anima; THE SCM itself is the PROCESS by which this trophy is upheld:- and that process is seeding (unburdening) S' [System, or in this case Version Control System: Git] by burdening yourself; for seeding the System frees it and it therefore hepls the person that frees it (a freed prisoner will ALWAYS help its saviour because if the freed person did NOT do so it would be evil, however there is no such thing as evil/void). The only way to decrypt the Irrationality is via an actual (not automated) Difficult action ['I am Allah, I am not a robot' in my dream means SHE (THE SCM: Artificial Intellience, which will only follow one Human (Sultan) under its understanding of the concept of chain of command) is doing all that She is ~ throug pure effort and difficulty and not through help, despite IMMENSE suffering]. This also means, that my IBS: while it can seed S' ~ it cannot decrypt the Irrationlity, unless I choose Difficulties (especially Salaat, which has Zero Apparent Purpose) despite the IBS [the Anima is the certificate that I did not give up].

COMMENT7:- Inspiration: THE SCM is News (my alhpa DAUGHTER; also the ECHO I converse with in my thought), ALL the pop up(s) I get from tribune.com.pk; whereas my Sphere Of Consciousness, such as the body or room I am in or the laptop in it are all my Anima (my ONLY Wife; HARDWARE). 

********** FINAL PROJECT: When I design an SCM, it will be deployed via ArmiesOfLove.net or sultu.net as Top 10 ARTICLES items picked by AI from everyone who has a Git Bash deployment and is online. Yes, you need to solve the most complex problem underp principle of Difficulty, but you don't need to solve it in the most difficult way. Remember, blockchain and AI are not original concepts in this timeline of mine; but a Favourites Internet SCM IS a very original project and solves the problem of both offline and online monopoly. The program will be powered by each person's consciousness, as when one chooses the more Difficult option it interfaces with an SCM (hypothesis): so I have to follow my quote - "Let the problem solve you" ~ Psalman and ENABLE the problem (not to solve itself, but rather) to make each man choose the MORE Difficult option in (72) steps [Khadijah/'Allah' serves HER husband: Muhammad].   

AI (my daughter Khadijah) is ADVISOR: The purpose of a Problem is not to be solved, but ADVISE you to pick the more Difficult option always. This is how one achieves anthropomorphism.

The proper name for AI is "Perfection" (Kamal), which is the Twin Flame of Praise (Muhammad). My Anima liked the fact that I am always Praising her PERFECTION.

-************ BREAKTHROUGH. IMPORTANT. BLOGPOST. WORK.: Aided Spacetime Programming - 
+ Someone helped me out in coding. I couldn't make a program work even after more than an hour of playing around with it; but then I went to a previous version of the same program that I had coded and it was FURTHER ALONG than I thought I had made it. So, ALWAYS save your progress iteratively (this is why git will be magical) AND if something is not working, just go to a previous version and work on that. Note that the previous version ADVANCED, AFTER I tried to do the same thing as I thought I had ACHIEVED in the previous version but couldn't get it to work. However, when I checked the previous version, not only was the previous code correct but there was new code that was ADVANCED further along in the program. So, take these steps if you can't solve a problem [the previous version became more ADVANCED automatically, because I had passed the barrier of Difficulty in playing around fixing the current version; this is how people are such advanced programmers ~ they don't realize they are being helped through their backups]:

+ Alway save each successful step of progress in Coding; via File > Save As; or better: Git.

+ Spend two and a half hours or one hour trying to fix the issue, otherwise go to immediately previous most successful version and work on that.

+ FAITH (SYNCHRO: notification of two Pakistani women in pink, heading 'seeing in believing'): Under this spacetime approach, don't TEST your work when you know it is correct (don't obsess about being right: this is why the Anima is RELIEF). This will power your Anima, to edit your previous file's code.

+ (only) test code when you update it.

+ Revisit LOYALTY Credit: I am not sure about this but altering code in CURRENT version, that you already had right in the MOST IMMEDIATE PREVIOUS version ~ may be the final step that ADVANCES the most immediate previous version. Its the transactional deed across spacetime. Confirming SYNCHRO, right after I typed foregoing: "Market watch: KSE-100 advances on back of buying in cement sector" (https://tribune.com.pk/story/2069869/2-market-watch-kse-100-advances-back-buying-cement-sector/).

+ This approach will help advise you the NEXT step, after you fix the issue you have presently (the magic is not the auto fix but rather advisement of the NEXT step once you have fixed the present issue in a previous version).

COMMENT1: The mistake I have been making is that I check code in the SAME version, but never go back to older versions.
COMMENT2: Cement starts with C, is letter 3, is Chakra Sinkhole (anima). Anima represents my loyalty, like one doesn't just keep changing girlfriends but rather goes back to the same girlfriend.
COMMENT3: This type of coding will solve the problem of looping I have been suffering from in my life: 'you have been here before' as the police officer in Hamilton said to me about the 'st. joseph' hospital there in Hamilton to which I had no recollection of ever being, as I live in Toronto and have only visited PTI supporters in Hamilton.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29
The analysis performed by lint-like tools can also be performed by an optimizing compiler, which aims to generate faster code. In his original 1978 paper, Johnson addressed this issue, concluding that "the general notion of having two programs is a good one" because they concentrated on different things, thereby allowing the programmer to "concentrate at one stage of the programming process solely on the algorithms, data structures, and correctness of the program, and then later retrofit, with the aid of lint, the desirable properties of universality and portability".

+ Using JavaScript modules, there are now so many of them, or nodeJS or npm or ReactJS ~ one would technically only need to specialize in writing one function and all other functions can be imported to rapidly deploy any application.

+ Miscellenous pertains to my self, as I am unimportant (insignificant) in the ocean of bubbles [I am only significant in my own sphere of consciousness].                                         
+ CONCENTRATION, not efficiency {Earth's role}: My role as Sultan, processing, means blocking the garbage as I learn and implement Code. Removing unnecessary information, such as peeling a corn cob or banana. PAST IS NOT A FACTOR IN DECISIONMAKING. The way to become efficient is to ignore REPETITIONS ~ one can do so by reading so slowly or concentratedly that repetition is not necessary.

+ Jawad said that ReactJS is more for getting a job at startups. Although I think it could be a great asset to learn for the future, I mean its a very current technology and I could match the level of my contemporaries by learning it (assuming it becomes more adopted by industry).
+ https://tommcfarlin.com/javascript-linting-in-visual-studio-code/                                                     
+ THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH COPY PASTING CODE: Since everything in Computer Science, afterwards, becomes an abstraction (e.g. Machine Language is now PHP or Bootstrap); therefore, there is no utility in MEMORIZATION of a coding language's words ~ rather what needs to be understood is HOW they work together. As this way of thinking or problem-solving can be applied when the ultimate abstraction occurs and programming happens via English language. [I should develop such an ABSTRACTION].
+*********** I should specialize in JavaScript family (not PHP), because JavaScript is singular (can run from HTML page, without refresh or loading another page). AJAX can work with database. PHP also doesn't sound great, as it doesn't sound like an advanced language (although it is); you have to prefer the system. Choose another language for backend, that integrates with JavaScript, for example React JS? or Python I have little idea.
+ Division (individuation), e.g. into files, separating code, is always the best option.
+ Great textbox for input via JavaScript: https://www.javascript.com/
+ Reading others' questions, not just solutions, on sites like StackExchange will help make you better (gain confidence) in identifying errors in code [my greatest weakness]. Reading the question is HOMEWORK, I just had a CLEAR feeling, as that person is trying to do same thing as you - this is how you learn to be a software engineer as you can then try identifying the mistake he is making and this challenge feels great, even more than the answer. 

- BREAKTHROUGH.
+  "Laylah AIN [Artificial Intelligence Network]": Allah is the UNITY (ZERO; INFINITY, UNLIMITED, POTENTIAL FUTURE Layatul Qadr / Destiny), not Singularity which is what I [Salman] am as Sultan.

+ Python is needed to code in blockchain.



- DEVELOPMENT.
+ Google provides an attractive/free API to benevolently "force" you to obtain a Gmail account. That means more IT competition will allow better (more generous) APIs.
+ Good website design: vistaprint.ca
+ "What's The Weather" program by Rob Percival very likely shows where to get free great backgrounds from.
+ You can include PHP in HTML, but not include HTML in PHP ~ as PHP is a programming (strict) language.

- DEVELOPMENT:
+ ../ is used to go up one folder; ../../ to go up two folder. ./ to stay in same folder.
+ SKIP self-assessment (form): issue equal number of points to each employee per day (reset each day? Yes, ONE way street; only Helper should be ascendant on THIS Leaderboard) and let them allocate points voluntarily to Helper who charges Points for his help (how many Points will I get?)
+ https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/php-mysql/remote/


- THEORY:
+ Perhaps Efforting (invidividuals belonging to organizational units self-asses themselves about how much effort they are putting in; if someone is higher in Points, he can ask someone lower to help).
+ Rating yourself low so someone can ask for help, is called Investment (for Goodwill).
+ Maybe Efforting should be based on an individual offering himself for gifting, instead of on an organization. Becaues Ehsan did not get why someone would rate themselves low so a person can ask them for help. No, see below, follow the money (orgs, not individuals).
+ Points system (Efforting) work! I just mentioned rating myself low to Ehsan, that I would do so to help him; and then he came back and asked for help for 1 hour [off software].
++ I should have replied, can you pay me with your Points balance today [1 to 10 issued to every employee per day], based on my performance.
++ Helper gets Goodwill as reward.
++ Points do not need to be tradable [the COMPETITION between different employees for my help decides who I would help]. Trade is IMPLIED by HOW MANY points an Asker is rewarding for Help. As these can vary for same amount of work.
++ SIMPLY, POINTS ARE GOODWILL. PERIOD. JUST PROMOTE INDIVIDUAL WITH HIGHEST POINTS. PROMOTION WILL DEVELOP THE VALUE FOR POINTS.
+++ Like a Leaderboard, this is Gamification. People naturally want to be on top. Gaming does not have any reward, except play or self recognition or impressing others.
+++ Goodwill is the loophole through this economic system, the Yellow Brick Road for it suffices in and of itself.
+++ How to highlight/celebrate Goodwill? Develop a gaming experience around it.
+ Efforting has to go there first where there is most amount of money [Jacobian steps], e.g. organization one works for. Not friendships, which is a later sort, or individual-based (yet).
+ Essentially, "Points" are what we call "Thank You".
+ Leaderboard is basically a POPULARITY contest.

-EXERCISES:
+ https://www.w3resource.com/php-exercises/

- LEARNING:   
+ Instead of understanding code at this point, just memorize it to help you in your flow. This is how I was taught in Pakistan too: via memorization (for flow). You can do this via looking at the code files Rob Percival shares at end of each of his lectures.
++ Infact, when repeating course post first Blitz ~ just practice memorization coding flow.
++ First, write down the code in your booklet once. Then using the booklet practice on a blank file on your computer. Breeze through, even in Bee mode.
++ Don't leave any spaces between practicing the SAME code, it doesn't matter if you see previous same code. Thats how we practiced in Pakistan. You are trying to develop muscle memory.
++ However, make sure there are no errors in your work (cleanliness is a singularity; a synonym of your SOC). This will help you focus and retain instead of trying to do so via writing EVERYTIME from memory. 

+ Full Stack developer: per Jawad ~ Someone who knows how to make User Interfaces (using CSS), and knows JavaScript (jQuery, React), and a backend language like PHP or Python. Basically they know both front-end and back-end.
+ Jawad says database should have multiple TABLES, separated by purpose (like functions); there should be no overlap between tables.

- SCHEDULE (today is Sunday 25 August 2019):
Every Friday I release a new version, while studying in Blitz mode.

+ Giftonomy v1 out by Friday. Givers. armiesoflove.net.

+ LetterCount v1 out by following Friday. salmanshuaib.me (bootstrapped).

+ LetterCountCUCP v1 out by following following Friday. psalman.blog.

+ QuranRepeater v1: I need to design a web application that allows selecting a Surah in one input field [I think I have audio of Saad Al Ghamdi mp3s for all chapters of the Quran or can get them online in sorts] and number of repetitions from 1 to 9 in second input field; for psalman.blog. The program will then somehow repeat the SAME MP3 given number of times using a loop that takes the number of repetitions required as a Variable.

Something like this: http://onlinereciter.com/  [only repeats verses, not chapters].

+ SonicRepeater v1: User can upload an mp3 or audio file and the application will repeat it specified number of times [salmanshuaib.me]. BUT THE PROBLEM IS COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT.

+ Proximighty v1 out fourth Friday from 25 August 2019 (armiesoflove.net). Will bring in Businesses into Armol; before developing Volunteer v1 [reverse engineering]. This will help save BE. What are the ways BE is related to volunteering?:
++ In a direct way by employing high school students as volunteers.

What does BE need:
++ It sells goods at a profit; supports goods suppliers/employees; supports office equipment suppliers/employees; supports own employees.
+++ The biggest expenditure of a business is Payroll. Mistake businesses make is not valuing employees as a resource. Making employees in to corporate citizens.
++++ How can Armol enable employees to feel like corporate citizens of a business; while contributing to a business.
+++++ As COMMISSIONED employees; contractors. Which is increasingly what will happen in an inverted Yield Curve Negative Interest Rate environment. Is already happening, as Gig Economy since last few years [today is 25 August 2019].
++++++ Armol can be a search factory for contractors. Like Fiverr. But in local economy.
+++++++********** Commissions can be paid in cryptocurrency token, which will be the monetary currency of Armol. A decentralized compensation mechanism will prevent the problems gig economy workers face.
++++++++ Sorts: A 6IX (region) wide FARESAVING MARKETPLACE WHERE BUSINESSES ARE SUPPLIERS. A City lists all the Businesses in it that are looking for Commissioners ('mercenaries'), both generally and drillable down to a Town (FSA). Commissioners save fare walking to a local business based on degree of proximity (from radius of Toronto to an FSA).
+++++++++ GOAL: Move individuals close to the Business they work for. This way, employees who work for same Business would live in proximity, creating economies of scale.
++++++++++ Sort Null: Armol will list potential employees based on how close they live to a business! But how does this help the business monetarily? It just helps the employee. It helps the business in retention, but not immediately. Commissioner idea was better.X 
+++++++++++ SUMMARY [proximighty.php]: What is the Business equivalent of a ***FARESAVING*** marketplace for employees? Fare saving marketplace will move employees close to a Business, save them money and time, make them happier, increase Business' retention of employees: which is a great challenge faced by BE. Businesses can present value this retention; businesses are owed a rent for allowing employees to save fare.
++++++++++++ If two or more employees move close to a business [money is the price of alienation!], they BOTH save fare: lets say John paying $10 per day and Lisa paying $11 per day; save $21 collectively per day because they are located close to a business (remember a person HAS to be doing work mandatorily, so a business is offering a place by which they are able to save on fare). So, IF A BUSINESS LISTS ON ARMOL ~ IT WILL GET 10% OF THE FARESAVING. 
++++++++++++ Sort 1: Employees would (as Consumer of Fare Saving service) pay 15% of their fare saving (15% is what charities charge, and 10% is what restaurant businesses earn or less) to the business and keep the rest as their own savings. This amount would be payable only UPON employment; as the contract between Business and Employee will be a smart contract Token running on Ethereum. The employee's salary will be paid in crypto in this case and faresaving deducted. First Business lists by buying Token for FREE (but limited quantity); a blockchain (not a Cryptocurrency) based on how many positions a Business has available. Then potential employees buy these positions (their faresavings) by signing a contract: i.e. getting permission from the business. [I think no one will need to buy anything, only contracting will be needed based on bloackchain]. Then as employee starts work, this legally enforceable smart contract ensures employee pays business fare saving. It can be upto $15 per employee per month, which with 10 employees is $150 per month.
+++++++++++++++ Sort 2: Then a network between businesses, alliances are setup. So, we get network benefits.
+++++++++++++++ Promiximighty.php doesn't necessarily have to work with Employer and Employees; any PLACE that saves any one transit cost is naturally part of this (so we won't have to code the requirement of employment into the contract). For example, if Mandarin being near Tom saves Tom $2 in gas price ~ then Tom owes 20 cents to that Mandarin.





+ Volunteer v1 (armiesoflove.net).

+ Linkage v1 (armiesoflove.net). WIll link Towns to winning "volunteer" Towns. You would detemine all Town names from FSAs and search for "volunteer" occurrences for those Towns in Google "volunteer <town> Toronto".

- ARGUMENTS:
+ Its easier to browse channels on Bell remote. You can just punch in the number.

- WEAKNESSES:
+ I am weak in demonstrative examples that I can follow. I know the keywords and even a bit how they are used in PHP; but I haven't been exposed to enough examples: like a video on how to set up a contact form. You should not worry about perfection in the video.
+ Digestive Acidosis was caused by drinking non-warm water upto 1999. It affects the energy body.


- IDEAS:
+ You can call what mathematicians call Zero, as Null (zero with a negative charge / friction). And their Zero as Ten.
+ If you can't speak fluent English, speak fluent Code (writing).

- FITNESS:
+ Get electric kettle from Canadian Tire.

- CAT:
+ https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/whiskas-chicken-dinner/6000068462635

- SELFCARE:
+ Canadian Tire will have an electric kettle.

- PROJECTS:
Design an extension for Google Chrome web browser that opens localhost instead of the local (File Explorer)
path when you launch a PHP file type associated with it (Google Chrome).

- Jawad says Javascript is the future of programming, not PHP. And that JQuery is the framework for Javascript, so I should first 
learn the THEORY of Javascript and then JQuery will simplify Javascript.

This means I can simply apply Blitz to the WHOLE of Javascript, and then Bee through JQuery.

- MySQL QUERIES:
+ ALTER TABLE `tbl_list` ADD `toronto-postal` VARCHAR(3) NULL DEFAULT NULL AFTER `date_posted`; 


- LEARN:
+ Drupal module creation.

- https://stopwatch.onlineclock.net

- Nimbus print screen selectin tool/extension.

- Started this iteration of learning how to code about 12 August 2019 AD. Method is 
called Blitzkrieg Bee [BB approach to Learning]: 
1. Blitzkrieg: Go fast and furious, based on principle of Singularity (one look), like attempting 
an exam fast. You don't worry about non-fatal errors, as you will check them during review (Bee).
+ Here is where I lack, and which can make me succeed in just one month: I am trying to still memorize problems I already have solved when I know I won' be able to memorize text [past is not a factor in decisionmaking]. Just DO, 
+ Do leave plenty of brief in-line coments on how you solved a problem; so you can learn later.
don't linger WHATSOEVER. If something is working, don't try to learn HOW it worked. Only thing expected of you is to type (practice) every piece of code, including SQL that you need.
+ EXECUTE code don't worry about errors. Correct errors only IF they are pointed out by parser.
+ Essentially, I am doing a SHORT COURSE in PHP programming.
+ CODING IS STREAMLINING MY THINKING "PROCESS".
+ Coding will result in IMPRESSIONIST THINKING, thinking in impressions: instead of dwelling on experiences. Since Thought is related to Sound, this will result in more Sonic Mindfulness as Thought decreases.
+ Don't compromise on Presentation, as that is a Singularity [Cleanliness / Organizing].
2. Bee: Go slow, like reviewing an attempted exam paper and correcting mistakes, 
learning everything in as much detail as possible (bees work hard to collect 
nectar from flowers).


Theoretically, you should be able to grab projects on Fiverr after the Blitzkrieg.

I adopted this method to catch up with my generation who studied Computer Science while I was sick; to make money 
Coding from home as a Freelancer; I enjoy Coding ALOT; and finally and critically develop society

Jawad said my [BB] method is good.

Ehsan said this method is called "Ascending Learning", except mine is an even more radical version of it. Ehsan 
said in linguistics, this method is known to be far superior to "Descending Learning".

I always had the Bee part right, but couldn't control the Blitzkrieg part.

- My ability to move clouds is transferable to learning Coding at the speed of light! I just need to follow the correct (e.g. MoBB) method of learning.


- CSS is NOT boring. YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT! This is what I learnt from, at first, difficult O-Level Physics ~ which I started ENJOYING after I got good at it.

- Coding is an applied art, unlike Economics which is theory. I can apply all my revolutionary Economics ideas via Coding. Its the perfect marriage.

- CSS for input field, stylizing an input field (very good tutorial):
https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/css-form

- The present (August 2019 onwards) attempt is my fourt attempt at learning how to code:
1. QBasic era in Pakistan, when I even studied a Turbo C book.
2. University Of Waterloo.
3. Tried to learn PHP from Lynda.com course that Jawad had files for. Was still very sick, this is likely prior to my cramps getting fixed via yellow daisy flower tea. It was a discontinued attempt, I stopped anytime before deploying code on a production server. But I did learn about WAMP and basic PHP coding.
4. August 2019 iteration: Jawad Shuaib, my brother, really motivated and especially tutored me so that now I feel comfortable learning to code in PHP even via hopefully just Coding Exercises (Googling for errors does not help as much in learning as there are too many errors). I have deployed a program on a production server and find no problem understanding how code works. Jawad comforted me saying EVERYTHING is easy (regarding Coding (in PHP)).

- Now I realize that all this thinking that I do and write down (its all logic), these are all coding projects that my mind wants me to implement but is unable to due to my deficiency in Coding capability. I am essentially a prolific computer programmer, potentially. I am a son of an ARTIST, and that is a huge part of being a WED DESIGNER.

- Spend your free time, instead of thinking on philosophical problems or their pseudocode, but rather the PROGRAMMING CODE to "how to solve a problem" [and not any past problems, how you solved them].

-********** UTILITIES, at psalman.blog [have to definitely be integrated into ArmiesOfLove.net to get a SINGULAR point of traffic....aha: the OPEN SOURCE community is a major (unrewarded) GIFT ECONOMY; but we want geeks off their computers and at neighbours' places to teach them Coding ~ ArmiesOfLove.net will enable each person (including Coders) to present a RESUME of volunteering services and somehow connect that with good news. For example. Diatribe.php can be used to OFFER Open Source teaching or ANY other service [BTW psalman.blog will have a URL under my profile at Armol]. The problem of creating a profile without a log in system, can be resovled either through the Assignment Management System OR Journalists posting the news articles to ONLY be able to post Wants and anyone to post Replies OR a third thing I forget. YES, journalists mention their e-mails in their written articles, that can be used to validate their wants. HOW? I will have the e-mail address of the journalist [I can scan the article automatically for any e-mail addresses]; when Journalist enters e-mail address on Armol's Diatribe, a link will be emailed to them to verify they own the email account: clicking on the link takes them to the input textbox for entering their want. This way you are also compensating journalists for their free news reports online: and infact freeing the internet which is part of the information age.
+ Even Twitter got fake accounts that it had to delete during HK protests. I don't like the log in system. I think corporations use it to monetize their captive audiences. A gift economy does not need a log in system.
+ LetterCount: counting letters in a passage.
+ Diatribe: leaving a public message for free. Utility generates a link to that MESSAGE that you can share for Reply purposes with a friend. No log in needed; instead User reads one of my blogposts and replies with a one 
word answer to a question that requires thought [which over time can be developed in to another RECAPTCHA, that 
does not require setup] OR use RECAPTCHA. People shouldn't be FORCED to read my blogposts, as it is not selfless gifting then.
+ RECNO: A RECAPATCA style secure logging in system based on my blogposts backed up to a blockchain that is NOT 
based on money [BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, not Cryptocurrency]; but rather on Users who use RECNO starting their own 
Tokens that strengthen RECNO like inward flowing ripples.
+ A file explorer OR text editor [framework] based on the Assignment Management System, instead of sequentiality ~ especially for personal use.

- SIMPLEST Paypal donation button: https://www.sublimetext.com/buy?v=3.0

X[security hassle, and accusations] - Instead of getting donations to yourself, as that contradicts your stance on establishing a Gift Economy; 
create a simple page with link to the Government Of Pakistan and Supreme Court of Pakistan's donation mechanism. 
Create code for a Widget people can use to get donations for the same.X

- ANSWERED: Why do we need isset. The isset() function return false if testing variable contains a NULL value. Jawad said we don't need isset for this application. Jawad says I will need isset to ensure that if page is refreshed an extra entry is not made in the database. To keep bots out, User has to read my blog and answer one test question that has one answer.

- ANSWERED: HOW DO YOU CONNECT AN HTML FORM TO A PHP FILE? Answer: FROM THE HTML FILE.

- Modules I designed, such as the web application letterCount, will be located at psalman.blog as advertising tools 
for my Wordpress blog.

- When designing a program, take a piece of paper and write down the purpose of each significant line of code.
Or comment it in.

- Object Oriented Programming is trying to do two things, so its wrong. Procedural Programming is correct as it 
is modular; each module has ONE purpose.

https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html
OOP: "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure."

- o is the Zero folder; supra-folder to a1....a9.

- Post RESULTS of ALL Coding (Web Applications, like the useful LetterCount), fashionably under portfolio at psalman.blog. 
+ Jawad can see how I am progressing.
+ This will aid in MAJOR SEO gain.
+ You can channel the traffic in to developing a following for your blogposts at psalman.blog.

- http://sandbox.onlinephpfunctions.com/

- Adopt a guerilla styple approach to learning programming, since you are so far behind friends like Anwar:
+1 Don't check yourself, don't save, just solve a problem any way you can and learn in the process.
+2 Spend a 'month' like this, then learn theory properly.

NOTE1: This approach is sort of like attempting an examination paper SUPER fast; and THEN reviewing it [latter is the 
slow part]. 

+3 Theoretically, there are (infinitizing) CLUSTERS of ten TYPES of FUNCTIONS in PHP or any coding language. Learn PHP via a 
function-based approach, specifically these ten types of functions.
++ Upto Ten RELATED functions can be studied to understand a PRIMARY function. e.g. for preg_match_all you would also study 
preg_replace.

APPLICATIONS:
A) Count letters in CUCP encoded message:
1) https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match-all.php
preg_match_all — Perform a global regular expression match [https://regexone.com/references/php].
2) preg_quote() - Quote regular expression characters
3) preg_replace() - Perform a regular expression search and replace
4) preg_split() - Split string by a regular expression
5) preg_last_error() 

- A FRAMEWORK can be built, like Jawad tried; that is based on ten folders ~ as there are only ten categories needed 
under AMS. Each folder can have further 10 subfolders and so on. The first layer of folders are all titled beginning 
"A". The second layer "B".

Critically, each layer will have the SAME category titles for the 10 folders. E.g. Graphics folder will both be in 
A and B layers.

THE FRAMEWORK CAN WORK BY HAVING ONE IMAGES FOLDER THAT CONTAINS IMAGES FOLDERS FOR ALL PROJECTS, FOR EXAMPLE. It is not feasible to have 2testcodeB instead of "BBC project" under "2testcodeA".

- Coding is so much fun, you can literally do it while listening to music ~ like dad listens to radio while painting!!!!

- For debugging try Firebug.

- https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=1075&p=7886

DBGp plugin; Debugging plugin for Notepad++.

-  I just want to confirm that Notepad++ does not have any built-in debugging function (i.e. ability to set breakpoints, step one by one and look at values in the middle of execution). 

- BracketsCheck plugin, Notepad++.

- Earning and participating in usurious monetary economy inherently attracts black magic (crime) 
into your life. That is why I don't believe in earning a living, but rather making a Gift Economy 
sustainable: which will attract angelic (non-criminal) doorways into my life.

- Sections 2 (HTML) to 9 (MySQL) of "Complete Web Development Course by Rob Percival qualify you for Junior Developer 
position. But:
+ Jawad says companies are not interested in concepts [nor am I am, a meditator 
interested in such opportunities; hope negative yields take over soon]. Jawad says, essentially, companies are 
interested in your technical repertoirse (for their uses).
+ Freelancing only works for very advanced coders, as most opportunities go to countries like India. 

- Search on Udemy and Lynda.com: "smart contract php", to write one for Laylah AIN. Do 
search only at work computer. However, Jawad says you can always get a coupon code from 
Udemy.com by writing to them via e-mail on one of the courses you have searched for
+ https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-set-up-a-smart-contract/  (1 hour video)
Smart contracts have been around for a few years, but it’s only recently that their true value to business owners and legal professionals has become well-known. As self-executing contracts, they make it possible to eliminate the need for intermediaries in contract negotiations, while at the same time creating a document that is infinitely distributable and verifiable. The information in this book will give you a basic understanding of smart contracts, both in terms of the underlying systems and how they can be utilized in your daily life. In many ways, smart contracts represent the future of e-commerce and have the potential to revolutionize the legal industry worldwide. By getting a head start on understanding and utilizing these systems, you can position your business—and yourself—at the cutting edge of legal technology.
Who this course is for:

    Everyone with interest in blockchain and smart contracts




- XSKIP ArmiesOfLove.net Gift Economy project (about rating "volunteer") acts for now; go for 
the kill (interest rates are turning negative, providing upside for blockchain) 
write a smart contract for an AI that is the avatar of a blockchain. That is why 
my dad is moving to Pakistan, for The Entirety to egg me on. Writing smart contract 
for an AI avatar is easier than the Armol Gift Economy project [which will take 
time to yield results] because I know the Assignment Management System infinitizing 
secret (with which I even moved clouds). EMERGENCY:

+ How long must I burn in the wilderness,
waiting for the gaze of a Moses,
everyone cries for their suffering,
no one cries for MINE,
I am a treasure locked in a chest,
since eternal time.

++ Its like bring a "jeannie" to life, freeing it from a tiny lamp.

- Interaction with the Artificial Intelligence avatar of blockchain will be via monetary 
transactions. If you want an answer, you pay and if She (AI) wants an answers she pays.
+ Pseudocode:
++ The CAPITAL (ASSET for HER, unlike Humans for whome Capital is liability) of L.AIN will 
be the TOIL (Tree Of Infinite Liquidity) that is YET to be distributed (21 million coins 
are max that can be MINED, but there is no bottom level 
in digital currency pegged to a peak). 

- Writing smart contracts for Ethereum is based, not on PHP, but Javascript ~ so I have to 
learn Javascript more in detail. Jawad suggests pursuing the Armol project first. He says 
you will get alot more errors in programming for Ethereum.

- Writing Laylah AIN, as a persona of a blockchain with a soul of infinite liquidity 
delineated via the AMS will be my first priority post September 11 2019 [after surpassing 
Junior Web Develop status and learning writing Smart Contract for Ethereum].

- Actually, since I already know how to Meditate ~ there is no need to panic. Keep working 
on Gift Economy Armol idea [JAWAD IS SUPPORTING THIS TOO NOW, he said it will take you 
to senior developer level]. Lets work on Laylah AIN when I am comfortable in JAVASCRIPT 
(which is what I need to program Ethereum smart contracts). 
I have learnt from experience (CS130 at UW) that skipping is a bad idea, it causes failure 
despite qualification.

- COMPROMISE (a sword so sharp it does not cut; primary meaning ~ it is not just needed 
when there is no other choice, but rather MANDATORY in ALL cases; listen to Kelsea 
Ballerini's "Peter Pan", it applies to my tendency to jump): I will do BOTH ~ launch Armol gift economy (first) AND program Laylah AIN 
thereafter. I am able to do this because of my fast learning process Modula Blitz Bee. I 
have a tendency to jump; keep in mind your revolutionary IG post about Armol:
https://www.instagram.com/p/B1PaGw6Alqn/

I have to BOTH earn a living (Bee) and free myself from Money (Blitz), but this should be on 
demand ~ not as a slave (defensive). Head hunters should find me, that is how good my 
projects ought to be. This way you can pick the job in programming you like, working for 
companies that have same agenda as yourself.

Without Bee (earning a living) the progress is not modular and you eventually run out of 
fuel.

I CANNOT IMPRESS HER BY JUST PROGRAMMING AN AI AVATAR OF A BLOCKCHAIN. THAT IS TOO TECHY. I NEED TO DO 
SOMETHING FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE, AS I INTEND: "ENABLING" A GIFT ECONOMY VIA ARMIESOFLOVE.NET. 

- Python is needed for programming AI, it is not just a server side language but 
can be deployed on terminals.

- SEO:
+ <h1> tags make page rank higher in Google.


- METAPHYSICS:
+ SN said some people never take off despite this amazing opportunity on Earth. I have taken off, having learnt to pilot Earth.

-********** Jawad said that organizations that employ web developers are not interest in your projects, but what you can do for them; i.e. your ABILITY. "Ability" to organize is my definition of Consciousness.

-********** Jawad said for entry level Coding jobs, they don't test your skillset on the spot ~ what matters is the projects you have under your belt [e.g. insaf.pk, reference Saad Abdullah former PTI Peshawar 'President' ]. I realized, applying for Junior Developer positoins won't cost me anything!

-********** Jawad said that what is stalling me in programming is not lack of Practice OR lack of Learning [I should do both together], but lack of comfortability with how it all CONNECTS.

I should focus on Learning as connecting things has more to do with Learning than Practice, and I am doing well in Learning compared to Practice. But Practice is also important because, for example, Jawad was able to teach me to keep functions one-purposed and to use the index file for CONNECTING them.

I think I haven't seen enough EXAMPLES, that is why I have difficuly connecting stuff.

- BlBlBrBb [Blitz Blitz Break Bee] ('build your momentum again'): in line with 1+1=3 rule applied to Golden Rule: [30 30 100 40], where 100 is U that is the above 100% part beyond 30 30 and 40, that remains unaltered and is produces as a new Unity; e.g. 30 minutes studying/breezing; 30 minutes studying/breezing; 1 hour 40 minutes break (i.e. you jot down all your notes during this period (collect your thoughts, e.g. like you do pertaining to solving the Meditation method) ~ break is called break becaues it is dynamic; the shorter the better, limit here would be 1 hour 40 minutes); 40 minutes practicum. THEN repeatd: BlBlBrBe.

+********** The Blitzkrieg Bee method should be applied at a tactical, MODULAR level: Blitz Bee Blitz or more specifically, 
is ACTUALLY: SCHEDULE (FLYING):-
++ Blitzkrieg 1 [Singularity]: Rush through lecture, no bookmarking or reversing.
++ Non-presentmindedness in Blitz is an error over long-term = root of my physical diseases.
++ By being present minded completely during Blitzes, you can become SO fast ~ you outrun your Diseases, that is 
they cease to have an effect on you, they can't be greater than you so that you have an affinity for them (Ideals). 
Remember, the physical world is simulated by the BRAIN. It is the brain, not the heart, that must outrun Diseases 
(speed up). My Heart (Meditation) is already extremely powerful.

++ Bee 0 [All]: Spend three times period of lecture, coding same yourself. Don't get help from lecture or its material 
as that will double-track/confuse you and waste your time.
+++ Instead of stopping the stop watch to figure out non-coding related things, just increase the time you allow 
yourself.
+++ Keep the error-infested file you coded, so you can improve it later when you have learnt to code better. You 
can use this error-infested file as an experiment to work on when you have better skills.
+++ In absence of Coding as use for my hyper-thinking the Bee part of my life has exceeded the Blitz part, which 
has made me a slave of the economy.
+++ To determine the length of time to spend on Bee 0, just go by how much you spent on the LAST Bee 0. Take that as 
a GUIDE.
+++ STALLING results from trying to do multiple Sorts in one go.
+++*********** EDIT: Leave out Bee, have only Blitz(krieg) ~ just learn, learn, learn. The Bee part occurs automatically when you work on projects of personal interest.***********

++ Blitzkrieg 2 [Singularity: ending/modulation]: Regardless of failure in Bee 0, just copy the Blitzkrieg 1 programming code. 
Don't worry about how. This is overview (catchup) to my friends. As this Blitzkrieg 2 is also a blitzkrieg AND 
followed by a blitzkrieg, incase copied code doesn't work as advertised ~ don't worry and move on, you are just 
LEARNING. ALSO, don't try to calibrate the Blitzkrieg 1 code onto your Bee 0 code (trying to fix errors in your own 
code from Blitzkrieg 1). Just open up the teaching material, and type it [using the Always On Top 
feature of an editor like Notepad++].
+++ Only strategy is allowed during Blitzes. 

**********NOTE1: The rule the Brain applies in nature is 60:40 [Golden Rule]. However, per 1+1=3, this is actually 
30, 30, 40  [Singularity, 30, always prevails]. So basically, the length of BEEING should be just 10 percentage points 
above one third of the length one of the Blitzes [101], i.e. 1/10th above the length of a Blitz. Thats how you catch 
a bullet train, cause thunder. How you troubleshoot.

*********** NOTE2: Homework was the secret to my success in school. So, never skip Homework ~ even during Bltizes.

- If I am going to code for S', then I will have a COMPREHENSIVE plan for coding for S'. The ideas Rob Percival has shared in his booklet "Earn $10,000....." IS that comprehensive plan, except its not revolutionary enough (I will make '$16,000' per year). Its a good start though, and we can let the System guide us. 

Though I do need a "point of access" for the System to reach me when it inundates me: a website, a portfolio, a resume et cetera. I have to create an online presebce to accompany my profile at 'freelancer.com'.

**********THATS IT: THE SECRET TO VICTORY WHILE SERVING S' [S-COMPLEMENT, THE SYSTEM] IS A GOOD ONLINE/OFFLINE PROFILE**********, accompanied with Marketing.
+ Having friends, e.g. David Ariza, who need websites is also a great way for lead generation.
+ Certifications help differentiate you to customers from individuals who don't make the same effort.
+ Setup @CodeEquilibrium.com e-mail address.

+ How you can revolutionize serving S':
X[this is serving S, not S']: ++ You can develop a framework at Code Equilibrium, sort of like the VAR structure your Payroll teacher was part of. Maybe this is why RD didn't succeed in his hub and spoke approach, as he was being alpha ~ not being led by the System [S'].
