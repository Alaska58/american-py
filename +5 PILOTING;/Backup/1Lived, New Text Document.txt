- Confucius: Disciples! Why is counting to 2552, if counting is done by Bi Cloud: good for u? 
- u: Trust_
- Disciples: Answer or forever hold your piece!
- u: If Girl Abc did not trust me; AND Girl Bbc also did not trust me - will Girl Abc say 1 OR 
Girl Bbc say 2 to me_
- Confucius: NO_
- Jesus Christ: he means, if Bisexual Cloud does not trust its empathic core, it will not count 
to 2552 for him!
- u: you mean every Girl is conscious?
- Jesus Christ: it is implied!
- u: what is implied?
- Disciples: just assume everything is conscious and we might upgrade your Pass-port picture.
