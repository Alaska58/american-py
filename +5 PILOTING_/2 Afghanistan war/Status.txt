- It is not necessary to proceed to Afghanistan immediately:
+ However, I will still proceed - to end Taliban based on uNESt [P1 C0 B0.5NOTSURE]_
+ Entirety and I have won infinite time as 2 mistakes (delay by an ally by 4 days) ensured this_
+ My ImperialDefence won upon entry, the Eternal Principle of Assertion, allows me to kindly sidestep from this fatalistic assignment_
+ POWER is (was) a time-barred problem; now that problem has been resolved:
++ A. Yesterday (FRIDAY 29 September 2022AD) we achieved 0 // 0.5 // 0.5 UP (Unarmed Provocation) = 2 which reproduces till infinity - UP has occurred_
++ Now, if someone deliberately OR negligently delayed me from going to defeat Taliban by 2 iterations (e.g. not providing the Cash I desperately need to proceed within time - delaying it four days MORE); then I am not responsible - and we have won infinite time (as 2 reproduce till infinity)_
++ I cashed out my $25K savings for $3K over a month ago, it was my money, yet bank (ally) did not pay me_ It is deliberate or neligent - not my mistake_

C. I can defeat the Taliban in my own way (CCN-M) which is most operable by individuals with high degree of Feeling_
