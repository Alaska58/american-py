- It is not necessary to proceed to Afghanistan immediately:
+ However, I will still proceed - to end Taliban based on uNESt [P1 C0 B0.5NOTSURE]_
+ Entirety and I have won infinite time as 2 mistakes (delay by an ally by 4 days) ensured this_
+ My ImperialDefence won upon entry, the Eternal Principle of Assertion, allows me to kindly sidestep from this fatalistic assignment post uNESt_
+ POWER is (was) a time-barred problem; now that problem has been resolved:
++ A. Yesterday (FRIDAY 29 September 2022AD) we achieved 0 // 0.5 // 0.5 UP (Unarmed Provocation) = 2 which reproduces till infinity - UP has occurred_ As evinced by a bomb blast at a mosque in Afghanistan_
++ B. What it means by "UP has already occurred" is that is if someone deliberately OR negligently delayed me post [0+0.5+0.5 = 2 => UP Confirmed], from going to defeat Taliban by even 2 iterations (e.g. not providing the Cash I desperately need to proceed within time - delaying it four days MORE after STEALING my Passport); then they are trying to fail me since/when I have already succeeded [UP was Confirmed]_
C. If I am not responsible, then somenoe else is responsible [may no harm come to anyone in the Entirety except it occur to i first]_

I am not responsible for undertaking the UP as first of all it has already occurred and secondly I am not being allowed to carry it out - by a period greater than 2 days - and we have won infinite time (as 2 reproduce till infinity)_ I cashed out my $25K savings for $3K over a month ago, it was my money, yet bank (ally) did not pay me_ It is deliberate or neligent - not my mistake_
++ C
C. I can defeat the Taliban in my own way (CCN-M) which is most operable by individuals with high degree of Feeling (Chain Of Command: belongs to Women first)_
