- We fought WARS to make time for either side of the family to find a solution (two solutions) to the problem of 
partnership, akin to how BioNTech has a model for finding the cure for diseases like COVID19 that is based on 
Adaptation (law of the jungle: competition)_

But once the solutions have been found [Girl Leader, Denting] then there is no need for Wars or Competition or 
Fighting - except under the Rules Of War (Gamification): a phenomenon that Millenials are well-suited to, 
particularly as we live(d) in our BASEMENTS! 

Girl Leader: Girl decides to accept or reject a partner_
Denting: Keep Dating until you find the one partner you are most suited to_
There is no marriage contract as ROMANCE is unconditional_


NOTE1: BiCLoud is incorrect term - correct term is Audience (of Partners)_
