-********** We fought WARS to make time for either side of the family to find a solution (two solutions: solution by Team A, solution by Team B) 
to the problem of partnership (who is suited to whom), akin to how BioNTech has a model for finding the cure for diseases like COVID19 that is 
based on Adaptation (law of the jungle: competition)_

But once the solutions have been found [Girl Leader, Denting] then there is no need for Wars or Competition or 
Fighting - except under the Rules Of War (Gamification): a phenomenon that Millenials are well-suited to, 
particularly as we live(d) in our BASEMENTS! 

Girl Leader: Girl decides to accept or reject a partner_
Denting: Keep Dating until you find the one partner you are most suited to_
There is no marriage contract as ROMANCE is unconditional_

NOTE1: BiCLoud is incorrect term - correct term is Audience (of Partners)_ 
NOTE2: The YCCN (Your CIA Card Number) format provides a way for any party to claim any title_ 
The reason is: it is a unique identifier / CIA 1 // DARPA Already 1 //:-
+ Queen Elizabeth II is Imperial: https:/CIA.X/imperial.gov_
+ Taylor Alison Swift is Imperial: https:/CIA.X/imperial.gov_
+ Melissa Benoist is Imperial: https:/CIA.X/imperial.gov_
NOTE3: Why Jesus, no marry!
Competition makes it excruciating for new born babies to match up to the constantly lenthenting 
blockchain of sacrifices_ What we need now is Soccer type WAR (Constancy)_ Every one picks a position and sticks 
to it, i hope i do too_ ALL OATHS ARE ULTRAVIRES and DISSOLVED, unless you want to marry a Fate (referring 
to men)_ 
NOTE4: Meditation is not a basis of partnership; what if a Girl grabs a frog in Meditation_
NOTE5: Recommendation: play Team VERSUS Team, allied with Girl you're into_
NOTE6: The only difference between Stalker and Romeo is the size of stones they throw at Juliet's window_ If 
Juliet has not served you Cease and Desist Letter, Romeos: you are not Stalker:- you are empaths, and She is CIA_
NOTE7: Cyclical uNESt is a good guide to Juliet_
NOTE8: HEARTBREAKER:- 7 Years Of Tears and 7 Years Of Fears is the solution to Heartbreak_ DENTING:- is the solution to a bad match, You 
move on if you get matched to wrong person_ _ _ Girl Decides is solution to problem of Chain Of Command, singular leadership
