Thesis: Punishing oneself is no longer necessary_

Inspite of the audience's expectations as to the annihilation of the religious logic of a Knight, not i_
i, having failed to chop off a limb as Muhammad threatened his daughter for stealing - offer to men a gift from Panacea: no longer shall 
we get Tattoos - if we mess up, that is fail Womenkind_

1_ First of all, i am getting a Tattoo ('audience applauses')_
2_ Secondly, it is not my dad's duty to provide monetary compensation for the quests that 
are legally my pride_
3_ If my credit history is suffering, and there is a misunderstanding between my team and 
my opponent's team: the only way to resolve this is my admission in the VIP system_
4_ Why: asks a member of the audience (jury): how the F does a VIP system related to you 
not getting a Tattoo OR getting one_
5_ If i get the Tattoo, i am being fake - as I have always kept my body Virginia_
6_ If i do not get the Tattoo, then i am frowning on every individual i admire - without judgment: such as those 
that do have Tattoos_
7_ Since reward is portioned out, according to the purpose of the enterprise: therefore, since the reward (result) of Tattoo
is pain, therefore if pulling out hair from my arm to punish myself sufficeth - hence i am VIP_
8_ But i was born VIP, majesties and monsieurs, i was born this way: a naked baby, armour: same as thine_
9_ uNESt: universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy; courtesy Professor John Nash (Nobel laureate):
+ EXPRESSION-based Decision: Should i (Salman Shuaib) switch from a Ketogenic (meat inclusive) diet to prior Glucose (vegetarian) diet?
NO/YES:
+ PASSION : 0.49+0.1=0.5 as uNESt TRINITARIAN [Taylor Swift says no, you're not Jesus Christ]
+ Compromise : 1   [Health: plants contain the Carbohydrate GLUCOSE which destroy an Empath's Glutathione molecules_ Glutathione is the Human body's only natural anti-oxidant] 
+ Budget : 1
----------
 2.5/3 NO, do NOT switch to GLUCOSE-based Vegetarian diet_ 

10_ uNESt: universal Nash Equilibrium Strategy; courtesy Professor John Nash (Nobel laureate):
+ EXPRESSION-based Decision: Should i (Jeff Bezos) switch from a Glucose diet to Ketogenic (meat inclusive) diet?
NO/YES:
+ PASSION : 1 [Salman does not know Jeff Bezos dietary preferences: 0.5; but does know via Common Sense that Jeff Bezos can not have a DIFFERENT diet than his Wife OR partner sitting at the same table]
+ Compromise : 1   [Health: meat does not contain Glucose, which destroys the body's only native Antioxidant: Glutathione] 
+ Budget : 0 [URGENCY OF MONEY: Money and Power are complements, Jeff Bezos hath 0 POWER]
----------
 2/3 NO, do NOT switch to Ketogenic Diet, i.e. any thesis can be defended as long as one is consistent in it_ It is possible, also, to switch thesis and pass with flying colors: as i {Salman Shuaib / sashuaij} did at Ryerson University, from Accounting to Economics and Management Science_ 
11_ As two Errors can account for Infinite mistakes, given time and reproduction: therefore 
the Empress Goddess Of Power Field Marshal Taylor Alison Swift [SYNCHRO. prototype, archetype]  
can eat either Ketogenic Diet or Glucogenic Diet or both or neither or any combination 
thereof or thereto [SYNCHRO. therewith, therefrom]_


P_S_: i regard beauty marks as Tattoos_
