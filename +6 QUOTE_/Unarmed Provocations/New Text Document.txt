-> NOTE1: An Unarmed Provocation, under Game Theory by Professor John Nash, causes the enemy to lose 
1/3rd of the battle at the outset - as it invokes Eternal waves of defence forever_

-> Cumulative Score*: 2 out of 1.5/3 required by my Conscience (a Taylor Alison Swift)_ 

+ Syria: 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5    //Attempted, but did not make it to Damascus - ended up involuntarily 
detained in psych ward_ We learnt two weakensses of i: fighting on two fronts simultaneously AND fear 
(of torture) - LATER solved as ACE: Audience Constancy Encircled_
++ During psych ward, since two is infinite, i realized the mission was truly an UP [Unarmed Provocation] 
because certain two assumptions bore true: inspiration:-
+++ Mary's Nightmare
++++ i am the first arrow in every BATTLE:
so absolute! i am declaration of WAR!
when i fall a million MISSILES rise:
inspired, devastated, IRRESISTIBLE! 
+++++ ending up in psych ward (detained, fed medicines that have severe side effects) is a fall_ 
+++++ buying the ticket, which costs hard work, is secondarily part of Unarmed Provocation too_  


* If others are forcibly preventing UPs [Unarmed Provocations], then we gonna use Cumulative Score 
instead of Directs (Unitary//Set//Category Totals)_
