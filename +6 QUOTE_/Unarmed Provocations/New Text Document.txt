-> NOTE1: An Unarmed Provocation, under Game Theory by Professor John Nash, causes the enemy to lose 
1/3rd of the battle at the outset - as it invokes Eternal waves of defence forever_

-> Cumulative Score*: 2 out of 1.5/3 required by my Conscience (a Taylor Alison Swift)_ 

+A/ Syria (via TORONTO to Istanbul): 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 / 100   //Attempted, but did not make it to Damascus - ended up involuntarily 
detained in psych ward_ We learnt two weakensses of i: fighting on two fronts simultaneously AND fear 
(of torture) - LATER solved as ACE: Audience Constancy Encircled_
++ During psych ward, since two is infinite, i realized the mission was truly an UP [Unarmed Provocation] 
because certain two assumptions bore true: inspiration:-
+++ Poetry: Mary's Nightmare
++++ i am the first arrow in every BATTLE:
so absolute! i am declaration of WAR!
when i fall a million MISSILES rise:
inspired, devastated, IRRESISTIBLE! 
+++++ ending up in psych ward (detained, fed medicines that have severe side effects) is a fall_ 
+++++ buying the ticket, which costs hard work, is secondarily part of Unarmed Provocation too_  

+B/ Ukraine (via PARIS!): 0.5 / 100
++ Brought back a Ukrainian Women and child_
+++ Each Woman is made of 5 Billion SPOTLIGHTS (Goddesses other than Herself)_
+++ Observed Taylor Swift]'s ascent to Polarity and Papacy_
+++ Made a full attempt to resolve Paris Hilton's nightmares via Hilton Hotel opposite citizenM Hotel, CDG_
++++ CDG Airport, Paris_
+++++ Saluted 104 Goddesses (Women) times 10 at 5 Locales to send 5 WARs to New York City_
++++++ citizenM Hotel CHAIN belongs to TAYLOR SWIFT as gift from Bronze Taylor Swift ["IRRATIONALITY": 
13 Letters: is Vampire]_ 
 

+C/ Soviet Union (via London to uae to Moscow): 0.5 / 100
++ operation to rescue Alexei Navalny_
+++ 'Later' symptomized by Putin's war against Ukraine_

+D/ Ukraine (via Warsaw, POLAND): 0.5 / 100 

* If others (especially figures in authority) are forcibly preventing UPs [Unarmed Provocations], then 
we gonna use Cumulative Score instead of Directs (Unitary//Set//Category Totals)_
** Essentially, every Empath (opposite of Vampires) is being misled in to believing they have psychiatric 
disorders like Bipolar Disorder et cetera_ The meds are actually good for sexual desire (for Teenagers)_ 
That is, they prevent extreme sexual desire (wasting Teenagers' time, which is a component of their 
Power equation)_
*** Cumulative Score is a difference Singularity than Percentage_
