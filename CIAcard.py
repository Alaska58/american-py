# CIA is the name of the original military force, formed to re-unite all Species under one banner: The
# United States Of America which constitutes the prototypical Goddess Of Power: TAYLOR ALISON SWIFT;
# (@taylorswift13) is, as USA (Reference: Jesus) the name of The Entirety [TEnt] (each

# Something written with greater feeling, and Women do have greater Feeling (Physics: Power), carries

# their CIA Card Number [#TIF22 #Toronto @CIA #Swifties @taylorswift13]


# Pseudocode:
# FORMAT: DOBAD+CurrentCity
# Entity enters its DOB and CurentCity (ResidentialAddress)
# Program appends "AD"
# Program computes value for the 5 Chevrons
# Program prints the officer General's YCCN, every rank is a General
# DOB = DAY dd mm yyyy

# NOTE1: Vitamin D, probably, restores Heterosexuality among men (attraction to Women alone).
# NOTE2: Centella Asiatica (Gotu Kola), though Cancerous if consumed too much, is the cure to
#
# 1. Obesity
# 2. Senescence
# 3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome
#
# as it probably supports Glutathione production in the body (turns Urine yellow, improves Liver function; Glutathione
# being the body's only native anti-oxidant).
# Plants contain Carbohydrates (Glucose) - which destroy Glutathione, the body's innate defence aginst ROS
# (Reactive Oxygen Species) and Radicals. This (destruction) is the cause of IBS.
# Sources of Glutathione: Glutathione drip (e.g. available at Dr. Tara Joan Campbell's in Toronto), Ketogenic
# Diet - as it restricts Carb intake and switches the body's metabolism ('combustion') to burning 'Ketones'
# instead of Glucose; the only SUSTAINABLE way to stay off the Glucose diet: become a meat-eater / as vege
# ketogenic diet not containing meat does not provide 0 Net Carbs like Meats do.
