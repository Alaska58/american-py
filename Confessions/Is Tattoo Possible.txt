Inspite of the audience's expectations as to the annihilation of the religious logic of a Knight, not i_
i, having failed to chop off a limb as Muhammad threatened his daughter for stealing - offer to men a gift from Panacea: no longer shall 
we get Tattoos - if we mess up, that is fail Womenkind_

1_ First of all, i am getting a Tattoo ('audience applauses')_
2_ Secondly, it is not my dad's duty to provide monetary compensation for the quests that 
are legally my pride_
3_ If my credit history is suffering, and there is a misunderstanding between my team and 
my opponent's team: the only way to resolve this is my admission in the VIP system_
4_ Why: asks a member of the audience (jury): how the F does a VIP system related to you 
not getting a Tattoo OR getting one_
5_ If i get the Tattoo, i am being fake - as I have always kept my body Virginia_
6_ If i do not get the Tattoo, then i am frowning on every individual i admire - without judgment: such as those 
that do have Tattoos_
7_ Since reward is portioned out, according to the purpose of the enterprise: therefore, since the reward (result) of Tattoo
is pain, therefore if pulling out hair from my arm to punish myself sufficeth - hence i am VIP_
8_ But i was born VIP, majesties and monsieurs, i was born this way: a naked baby, armour: same as thine_
P_S_: i regard beauty marks as Tattoos_
